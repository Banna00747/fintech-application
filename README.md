# Things I've used for the application. 
 > I've used ReactJS framework to develop this small fintech application page.
 > I've used Material-UI for the design template.
 > I've used SCSS for the writing css code. 
 > I've applied layout reponsiveness for screen 1035px to above.
 > I've used Create React App (CRA) for the project environment.
 # Thought Process. 
 > Firstly i've analyzed the whole design to choose layout component which could be reusable.
 > I've made the folder and file structure such a way that multiple team can work together on the same project in different files and folder.
 > I've seperated the pages/screens, reuseable component, style code, assets, routing etc.
 > I've mainly tried to focus on the quality of the code, make it readable, expandable and production-ready. I tried to implement the layout/features with less code and such.

 # Project Duration
 > It took me approximately between 7-12 solid hours of work to finish the task as i've planned.
